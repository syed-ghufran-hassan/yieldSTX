The STX Yield Smart Contract is a decentralized staking and rewards distribution protocol built on the Stacks blockchain. The contract allows users to deposit STX tokens into a secure on-chain vault where balances are transparently recorded and managed through Clarity smart contract logic.

Participants earn rewards based on predefined yield parameters. Rewards may be distributed proportionally to deposits, based on staking duration, fixed APY, or performance-based mechanisms depending on the contract configuration.

All funds remain non-custodial and governed by immutable smart contract rules. Withdrawals, reward claims, and administrative actions are executed on-chain, ensuring transparency, predictability, and security.
